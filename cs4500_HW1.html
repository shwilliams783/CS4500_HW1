     This program, HW1, will track the movement of a marker on a 10x10 grid.
     Inputs: 
     	None
     Outputs: 
     	The number of moves taken
        The final position of the marker
     	The result of the game (you win! / out of moves!)
        The maximum and minimum number of touches for any single cell
        The average number of touches across all cells

// Variables

// Current coordinates of the marker; one of these values will
// change by an integer from [-2,2] each cycle (most commonly 0).
var posX = 0;
var posY = 0;

// Total number of moves taken; will increment by +1 each cycle.
var count = 0;

// Starting grid touch counts; one cell will increment by +1 each cycle.

// NOTE: The simulation describes the starting marker as the bottom left corner
// of the grid, however for simplicity, I will define that cell as grid[0][0],
// currently the top left of the 2-D array below. This definition will cause
// position movements to the right or up to be the positive direction, and 
// position movements to the left or right to be the negative direction.
// If proper visualization is needed later, the array setup and directonal
// movement may need to be altered.
